# Getting started with SkinPacker & SkinViewer

SkinViewer is an application aimed to boost skin pack creation. SkinPacker is a special version of SkinViewer, that has importing and exporting capabilities, but requires confirmation, that the user has signed NDA with Mojang.

## Confirming NDA

The easiest way to confirm, that a user is under NDA is by checking whether they are on Mojang Slack.

* Subscribe to Team Plan (other plans don't have the SkinPacker)
* Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Yv4TCKEdQq)
* DM an admin, that you want a to confirm being under NDA (be sure to include your name on Mojang Slack)
* After receiving contact info, send them your email address you used to login into the MCDevKit site through Mojang Slack

## Installation

* Download SkinPacker/SkinViewer from Downloads page in client panel
* Double click the installer
* Follow the installer instructions

## Activation

* Go to [Client Panel](https://mcdevkikt.com/panel)
* Make sure you have active subscription
* Copy License Key
* Open SkinPacker/SkinViewer
* Paste the License Key when asked


## Creating first project

* Open the SkinPacker/SkinViewer
* Click `File > Open`
* Select a folder with skins (might also be empty)

Yes, it's that easy! The project is automatically saved when closing application or opening another project.

Adding, removing and editing the skins in this folder will automatically refresh the preview in SkinPacker/SkinViewer.
